it's not:

- Z3 vs Z2
- video capture interference
- zorro_ram_write_flag
- timing closure
- READs vs WRITEs
- axi protocol converter (happens with axi interconnect too)
- map_address in driver
- zorro related at all

could be:
- 

it happens for:
- DMA writes, on Z2 and Z3
- 

- first 2 bytes of a write happen to the place after the last address that was written

- address and data do not fit together
- when the address is given as data, distortions appear
